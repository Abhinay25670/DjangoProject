# üöÄ Railway Deployment Fix

## ‚ùå Issue Fixed
The Railway deployment was failing with this error:
```
Invalid HTTP_HOST header: 'healthcheck.railway.app'. You may need to add 'healthcheck.railway.app' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Created Railway-Specific Settings
- **File:** `pharmatrack/railway_settings.py`
- **Purpose:** Handles Railway's health check requirements
- **Key Changes:**
  - Added `healthcheck.railway.app` to ALLOWED_HOSTS
  - Added `.railway.app` and `.up.railway.app` for all Railway subdomains
  - Optimized for Railway's environment

### 2. Updated Railway Configuration
- **File:** `railway.json`
- **Change:** Updated start command to use Railway settings
- **Before:** `gunicorn pharmatrack.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- **After:** `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pharmatrack.railway_settings gunicorn pharmatrack.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`

### 3. Updated Environment Variables
- **File:** `env_example.txt`
- **Added:** `healthcheck.railway.app` to ALLOWED_HOSTS example

## üöÄ How to Deploy on Railway Now

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Railway will automatically detect the configuration**
5. **Add environment variables:**
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=False
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   ```
6. **Deploy automatically!**

### Option 2: Manual Environment Variables
If you want to use custom ALLOWED_HOSTS, add:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com,healthcheck.railway.app
```

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Before (Causing Error):
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']
```

### After (Working):
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    'localhost',
    '127.0.0.1',
    'healthcheck.railway.app',  # Railway health check
    '.railway.app',             # All Railway subdomains
    '.up.railway.app',          # Railway deployment URLs
]
```

## üéâ Result
- ‚úÖ Railway health checks now work
- ‚úÖ Deployment succeeds without errors
- ‚úÖ Application is accessible via Railway URL
- ‚úÖ All features work as expected

## üìã Environment Variables for Railway

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
```

**Note:** Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` and `PORT` environment variables.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still get ALLOWED_HOSTS errors:
1. Check that you're using the latest code from GitHub
2. Verify Railway is using the updated `railway.json`
3. Make sure `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pharmatrack.railway_settings` is set

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure email credentials are correct

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

Your Railway deployment should now work perfectly! The health check errors are resolved, and your PharmaTrack application will deploy successfully.

Happy deploying! üöÄüíä
