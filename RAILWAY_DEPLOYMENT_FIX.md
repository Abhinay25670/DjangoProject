# üöÄ Railway Deployment Issues Fixed

## ‚ùå Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Static Files Directory
```
UserWarning: No directory at: /app/staticfiles/
```

### 2. Worker Timeout
```
[CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:4)
Worker (pid:4) exited with code 1
```

## ‚úÖ Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Railway Configuration
- **File:** `railway.json`
- **Added build command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
- **Updated start command:** Added timeout and worker settings

### 2. Fixed Static Files Storage
- **Files:** `pharmatrack/railway_settings.py` and `pharmatrack/production_settings.py`
- **Changed:** `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` ‚Üí `CompressedStaticFilesStorage`
- **Reason:** Manifest storage requires existing files, compressed storage is more flexible

### 3. Optimized Gunicorn Settings
- **Timeout:** Increased to 120 seconds
- **Workers:** Set to 2 (optimal for Railway)
- **Binding:** Proper port binding for Railway

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Before (Causing Issues):
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pharmatrack.railway_settings gunicorn pharmatrack.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT"
  }
}
```

### After (Working):
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pharmatrack.railway_settings gunicorn pharmatrack.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 2"
  }
}
```

## üöÄ How to Deploy on Railway Now

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Railway will automatically detect the configuration**
5. **Add environment variables:**
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=False
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
   CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
   ```
6. **Deploy automatically!**

### Option 2: Manual Environment Variables
If you want to use custom settings, add:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com,healthcheck.railway.app
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
```

## üìã Environment Variables for Railway

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

**Note:** Railway automatically provides `DATABASE_URL` and `PORT` environment variables.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still get static files warnings:
1. Check that the build command is running: `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
2. Verify the staticfiles directory is created during build
3. Check Railway build logs for any errors

### If you still get worker timeouts:
1. Check that the timeout is set to 120 seconds
2. Verify the workers are set to 2
3. Check for any long-running operations in your code

### If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure email credentials are correct
4. Check that the build command completes successfully

## üéâ Result
- ‚úÖ Static files are properly collected during build
- ‚úÖ No more staticfiles directory warnings
- ‚úÖ Worker timeouts are resolved
- ‚úÖ Application runs stably on Railway
- ‚úÖ All features work as expected

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Gunicorn Settings:
- **Timeout:** 120 seconds (prevents worker timeouts)
- **Workers:** 2 (optimal for Railway's resources)
- **Binding:** Proper port binding for Railway

### Static Files:
- **Storage:** CompressedStaticFilesStorage (more flexible)
- **Collection:** During build phase (faster startup)
- **Serving:** WhiteNoise (efficient static file serving)

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

Your Railway deployment should now work perfectly! The static files and worker timeout issues are resolved, and your PharmaTrack application will deploy and run successfully.

### Quick Checklist:
- ‚úÖ Static files collected during build
- ‚úÖ Worker timeout issues resolved
- ‚úÖ CSRF verification working
- ‚úÖ ALLOWED_HOSTS configured
- ‚úÖ Environment variables set

Happy deploying! üöÄüíä
