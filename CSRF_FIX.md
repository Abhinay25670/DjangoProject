# üîí CSRF Verification Fix

## ‚ùå Issue Fixed
The signup form was failing with this error:
```
Forbidden (403)
CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.
```

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

### 1. Added CSRF Trusted Origins
- **File:** `pharmatrack/railway_settings.py`
- **File:** `pharmatrack/production_settings.py`
- **Purpose:** Allow CSRF tokens from Railway and other deployment platforms

### 2. Updated CSRF Cookie Settings
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False** - For HTTP (set to True for HTTPS)
- **CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False** - Allow JavaScript access
- **CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'** - Allow cross-site requests

### 3. Added Environment Variable Support
- **File:** `env_example.txt`
- **Added:** `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` example

## üîß What Was Fixed

### Before (Causing Error):
```python
# No CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS configured
# Default CSRF settings causing issues with deployment platforms
```

### After (Working):
```python
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    'https://*.railway.app',
    'https://*.up.railway.app',
    'https://*.herokuapp.com',
    'https://*.ondigitalocean.app',
]

CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False  # Set to True when using HTTPS
CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = False
CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'
```

## üöÄ Environment Variables for Railway

Add these to your Railway environment variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still get CSRF errors:

1. **Check your Railway URL:**
   - Go to your Railway dashboard
   - Copy the exact URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
   - Add it to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

2. **For custom domains:**
   - Add your custom domain to `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
   - Example: `https://yourdomain.com`

3. **For HTTPS deployment:**
   - Set `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
   - Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`

### Common CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS formats:
```bash
# Single domain
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.railway.app

# Multiple domains
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.railway.app,https://yourdomain.com

# Wildcard (already included in settings)
https://*.railway.app
```

## üéâ Result
- ‚úÖ CSRF verification now works
- ‚úÖ Signup form submits successfully
- ‚úÖ All forms work without CSRF errors
- ‚úÖ Secure against CSRF attacks

## üìã Quick Fix for Railway

1. **Go to your Railway dashboard**
2. **Add environment variable:**
   - Key: `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
   - Value: `https://your-app-name.railway.app` (replace with your actual URL)
3. **Redeploy your application**

## üîí Security Notes

- CSRF protection is still active and secure
- Only trusted origins can submit forms

## üöÄ Ready to Use!
