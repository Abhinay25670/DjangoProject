# ⏰ Railway Worker Timeout Fix

## ❌ Issue
Railway workers were timing out after 3 minutes, causing the application to crash:
```
[CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:5)
Worker (pid:5) exited with code 1
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Optimized Gunicorn Configuration
- **Timeout:** Increased to 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Workers:** Reduced to 1 (better for Railway's resources)
- **Max Requests:** Set to 1000 with jitter
- **Preload:** Enabled for faster startup

### 2. Added Health Check Endpoint
- **Path:** `/health/`
- **Purpose:** Lightweight endpoint for Railway health checks
- **Response:** JSON with status information

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling:** `CONN_MAX_AGE = 60`
- **Memory Limits:** 5MB for uploads
- **Health Check Timeout:** 300 seconds

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Before (Causing Timeouts):
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pharmatrack.railway_settings gunicorn pharmatrack.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 2",
    "healthcheckPath": "/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100
  }
}
```

### After (Working):
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pharmatrack.railway_settings gunicorn pharmatrack.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 300 --workers 1 --max-requests 1000 --max-requests-jitter 100 --preload",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health/",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Key Changes Made

### 1. Gunicorn Settings
- **`--timeout 300`** - 5-minute timeout (was 2 minutes)
- **`--workers 1`** - Single worker (better for Railway)
- **`--max-requests 1000`** - Restart worker after 1000 requests
- **`--max-requests-jitter 100`** - Add randomness to prevent thundering herd
- **`--preload`** - Load application before forking workers

### 2. Health Check Endpoint
```python
def health_check(request):
    """Simple health check endpoint for Railway"""
    return JsonResponse({'status': 'healthy', 'service': 'pharmatrack'})
```

### 3. Performance Settings
```python
# Performance optimizations for Railway
CONN_MAX_AGE = 60
DATA_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 5242880  # 5MB
FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE = 5242880  # 5MB
```

## 🔍 Why This Fixes the Timeout

### 1. **Increased Timeout**
- Railway's default timeout is often too short for Django startup
- 300 seconds gives enough time for database connections and static files

### 2. **Single Worker**
- Railway's free tier has limited resources
- Single worker is more stable than multiple workers
- Reduces memory usage and connection overhead

### 3. **Health Check Endpoint**
- `/health/` is lightweight and fast
- Doesn't load the full Django application
- Railway can quickly verify the app is running

### 4. **Worker Recycling**
- Workers restart after 1000 requests
- Prevents memory leaks and connection issues
- Jitter prevents all workers from restarting simultaneously

## 📋 Files Updated

- ✅ `railway.json` - Updated Gunicorn configuration and health check path
- ✅ `pharmatrack/urls.py` - Added health check endpoint
- ✅ `pharmatrack/railway_settings.py` - Added performance optimizations

## 🎉 Expected Results

- ✅ No more worker timeouts
- ✅ Faster application startup
- ✅ More stable deployment
- ✅ Better resource utilization
- ✅ Reliable health checks

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway worker timeout issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration

3. **Monitor the logs** to ensure no more timeout errors

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If you still get timeouts:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify the health check endpoint is working: `https://your-app.railway.app/health/`
3. Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
4. Check if there are any long-running operations in your code

### If the app is slow to start:
1. The 300-second timeout should be sufficient
2. Check if there are any database connection issues
3. Verify static files are being collected during build

## 🎯 Performance Tips

### For Railway Free Tier:
- Use single worker configuration
- Optimize database queries
- Minimize startup time
- Use efficient static file serving

### For Production:
- Consider upgrading to Railway Pro for more resources
- Use multiple workers if you have sufficient memory
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor performance metrics

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

Your Railway deployment should now be stable and free from worker timeout issues. The optimized configuration ensures reliable performance on Railway's platform.

Happy deploying! 🚀💊
