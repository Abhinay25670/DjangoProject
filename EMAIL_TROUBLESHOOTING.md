## ‚ùå Issue: Email Verification Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Signup page loads and stops
- No verification email received
- "Failed to send verification email" error

## ‚úÖ Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Hardcoded Localhost URL

- **Problem:** Email verification links were using `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- **Solution:** Added dynamic BASE_URL configuration

### 2. Added Better Error Handling

- **Problem:** Generic error messages
- **Solution:** Detailed error logging and user feedback

### 3. Added Fallback Email Backend

- **Problem:** SMTP failures caused app crashes
- **Solution:** Console backend fallback for debugging

## üîß Required Environment Variables

Add these to your Railway environment variables:

```bash
# Required for email functionality
SECRET_KEY=q5aagg@u1x-f8!^3(vpr4k)8&g53m7w=n9bp%=x!1q%2h$52a9
DEBUG=False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Add BASE_URL Environment Variable

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Click on "Variables" tab**
3. **Add new variable:**
   - **Key:** `BASE_URL`
   - **Value:** `https://your-actual-railway-url.railway.app`

### Step 2: Verify Email Configuration

Make sure these are set correctly:

- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` - Your Gmail address
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` - Your Gmail App Password (not regular password)
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` - Same as EMAIL_HOST_USER

### Step 3: Check Gmail App Password

1. **Go to Google Account Settings**
2. **Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification**
3. **App passwords ‚Üí Generate new app password**
4. **Use this password (not your regular Gmail password)**

### Step 4: Test Email Functionality

1. **Try signing up again**
2. **Check Railway logs for email errors**
3. **Check your email (including spam folder)**

## üîç Troubleshooting Steps

### If you still get "Failed to send verification email":

#### 1. Check Railway Logs

- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on "Deployments"
- Check the logs for specific error messages

#### 2. Verify Environment Variables

Make sure all these are set in Railway:

```bash
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

#### 3. Test Gmail App Password

- Make sure you're using App Password, not regular password
- Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Check if the App Password is correct

#### 4. Check Email Backend

The app now has fallback configuration:

- If email credentials are missing ‚Üí Uses console backend (emails print to logs)
- If email credentials are present ‚Üí Uses SMTP backend

### Common Error Messages and Solutions:

#### "Authentication failed"

- **Cause:** Wrong email or password
- **Solution:** Check EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD

#### "Connection refused"

- **Cause:** Network/firewall issues
- **Solution:** Railway should handle this automatically

#### "Invalid recipient"

- **Cause:** Invalid email format
- **Solution:** Check the email address format

## üéØ Quick Fix Checklist

- ‚úÖ BASE_URL environment variable added
- ‚úÖ EMAIL_HOST_USER set to your Gmail
- ‚úÖ EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD set to Gmail App Password
- ‚úÖ DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL set to your Gmail
- ‚úÖ Gmail 2-Step Verification enabled
- ‚úÖ Gmail App Password generated and used

## üöÄ Testing Email Functionality

### Method 1: Check Railway Logs

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your deployment
3. Check logs for email sending attempts
4. Look for any error messages

### Method 2: Test with Console Backend

If SMTP fails, the app will fallback to console backend:

- Emails will be printed to Railway logs
- Check logs to see if email content is generated

### Method 3: Check Email Delivery

- Check your Gmail inbox
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the sender address

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### For Production (Railway):

```bash
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

### For Debugging:

```bash
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
BASE_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```
