## ❌ Issue: Verification Emails Not Being Received

**Symptoms:**
- SendGrid is configured and shows "Using SendGrid for email delivery"
- No verification emails received in inbox or spam folder
- Users cannot complete registration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps

### **Step 1: Check SendGrid Account Status**

1. **Go to [SendGrid Dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com)**
2. **Check account status:**
   - Is your account verified?
   - Are there any account restrictions?
   - Check if you've exceeded free tier limits

3. **Verify API Key:**
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Make sure your API key is active
   - Check if it has "Mail Send" permissions

### **Step 2: Check SendGrid Activity**

1. **Go to SendGrid → Activity**
2. **Look for recent email attempts:**
   - Are emails being sent?
   - What's the delivery status?
   - Any bounce or block notifications?

### **Step 3: Check Railway Logs**

Look for these messages in Railway logs:
- `"Verification email sent successfully to [email]"`
- `"Error sending verification email"`
- `"Using SendGrid for email delivery"`

### **Step 4: Test Email Configuration**

Let me create a simple test to verify email sending:

## 🚀 Quick Fixes

### **Fix 1: Verify SendGrid API Key**

Make sure your API key in Railway is correct:
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=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
```

### **Fix 2: Check SendGrid Sender Authentication**

1. **Go to SendGrid → Settings → Sender Authentication**
2. **Verify your sender identity:**
   - Add `abhinay02005@gmail.com` as verified sender
   - Or set up domain authentication

### **Fix 3: Test with Console Backend (Debugging)**

Temporarily switch to console backend to see email content:

1. **Remove SendGrid API key** from Railway environment variables
2. **Add this instead:**
   ```bash
   EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
   ```
3. **Check Railway logs** - emails will be printed there

### **Fix 4: Check Email Address**

Make sure you're checking the correct email:
- Check `abhinay02005@gmail.com` inbox
- Check spam/junk folder
- Check promotions tab (Gmail)

## 🔧 Advanced Troubleshooting

### **Check SendGrid Statistics**

1. **Go to SendGrid → Statistics**
2. **Look for:**
   - Emails sent today
   - Delivery rate

   - Block rate

### **Verify Email Template**

The email template should generate URLs like:
```
https://web-production-609ea.up.railway.app/verify-email/[token]/
```

Make sure BASE_URL is set correctly:
```bash
BASE_URL=https://web-production-609ea.up.railway.app
